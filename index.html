Autonomy engineer building intelligent systems for aerospace and robotics. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder, focusing on autonomous systems and robotics. I work on making complex systems act without human intervention, from CubeSat mission planning to flight software architectures.

## Featured Projects

### Thesis: Safe Autonomous Systems via TPOs & Neural Networks
Developing expressive planning frameworks for complex multi-stage missions and stochastic control synthesis using neural certificates to prove safety guarantees for learned controllers.

### LASP Mission Planner
Built an autonomous constraint-based planning framework for NASA CubeSat missions (SPRITE & MANTIS), reducing planning time from 1-2 hours to 5-15 minutes while eliminating manual scheduling conflicts across three concurrent missions.

### Arkisys Flight Systems
Designed and implemented a fault-tolerant multi-MCU flight system architecture with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities, enabling autonomous operation without ground intervention. Presented at PDR.
