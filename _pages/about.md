I'm an autonomy engineer focused on building intelligent systems that operate without human intervention. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at CU Boulder, I work on problems at the intersection of formal methods, machine learning, and robotics, from CubeSat mission planning to flight software architectures.
